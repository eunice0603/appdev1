        <h2>Why I Want to Learn React</h2>
        <p>
          Honestly, I only first heard about React from my classmates last academic year. As someone who struggles with frontend development,
          I truly want to improve my skills by learning React. It is actually nice to learn more about it and I am looking forward to the hands-on
          activities that await us to learn more about and gain more experience with React.
