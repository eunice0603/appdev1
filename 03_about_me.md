## Why I Want to Learn Git & Github
Ever since developing web applications was introduced to us, I have been interested in using Git & Github. It is really essential to learn and utilize both Git & Github because it helps developers compile and manage their projects, track their codes, and collaborate with their fellow developers. I believe learning more about Git & Github, especially its git commands, would make developing web and mobile applications easier and smoother. After all, it is used in the industry. So studying it now, while still at school, would definitely give us confidence once we step out in the real world as it ultimately helps us establish an image in the IT industry.
