# Cloud Computing

## Purpose 
Cloud Computing is a revolutionary technology that allows businesses and individuals to store and access their files and various applications over the Internet, rather than storing them on local servers or personal computers. Increased efficiency, flexibility, and collaboration are just a few of the advantages cloud technology can offer to its users.

Nowadays, it has played a pivotal role in our everyday lives, since almost everyone around the globe is able to access cloud applications such as Google Gmail, Netflix, and the like. Cloud Computing lets you offload some or even all of the expense in terms of purchasing, installing, configuring, and managing mainframe computers, and such. Moreover, it increases speed and agility within companies and organizations. It also provides elasticity and self-service provisioning, which allows its users to scale capacity in response to spikes and dips in traffic. Lastly, it enables organizations to use various technologies and applications to gain a competitive edge among the industry they belong.

**In IT**:
Cloud computing lets you access services like storage, software, and servers over the internet whenever you need them, without having to buy or maintain physical equipment. It comes in three main types: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), which gives you the most control over your computing resources and works like having your own IT equipment online; Platform as a Service (PaaS), which lets you focus on creating and running your applications without worrying about the hardware and systems behind them; and Software as a Service (SaaS), which provides ready-to-use applications that the provider runs and maintains for you.

## Examples

**In Education**: 
One of the best examples of cloud computing used in Education is Google. It is well known for its Google Workspace cloud-based productivity apps, including Gmail, Calendar, Google Sheets, Google Slides, Google Drive, and Google Docs. There is also a special classroom version called Google Workspace for Education, which could directly assist and cater to the needs of students. Another product of Google is Google Classroom, which links Google’s online cloud applications to make completing or scheduling assignments easier through this central hub.
