Line 1
Line 2
Line 3

Realization:
I have noticed that using reset --hard, I am able to go back to my previous commits.
For example, I used the git reset --hard command with the commit-id of the "Add Line 2", the head will go back
to that commit and inside the file, the Line 3 disappeared.
Such a thing will happen also when I use the commit-id of the "Add Line 1", and both Line 2 & 3 will disappear
from the file.
